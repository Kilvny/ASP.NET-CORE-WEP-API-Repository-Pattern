## Introduction to Repository Pattern and Unit of Work

The Repository Pattern is a software design pattern that separates the data access logic from the rest of the application. It provides an abstraction layer to interact with the data storage while promoting better code organization and maintenance. The Unit of Work pattern helps manage the transactions and operations involving multiple repositories as a single unit.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- [ASP.NET Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) installed.
- Basic understanding of ASP.NET Core and Web API concepts.

### Installation

1. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd ASP.NET-CORE-WEP-API-Repository-Pattern
    ```

2. Build and run the application:

    ```bash
    dotnet build
    dotnet run
    ```

    The API will be accessible at `https://localhost:{PORT}`.

## Understanding Repository Pattern and Unit of Work
![Repositroy Pattern and Unit of Works](https://i0.wp.com/davidskyspace.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/UnitOfWork.png?fit=774%2C593&ssl=1) 

In this starter project, the Repository Pattern is implemented using the Generic Repository to provide a structured and reusable way to interact with the data layer. The repositories encapsulate the logic for querying and manipulating entities while promoting code reusability. The Generic Repository abstracts away the common CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, reducing code duplication.

The Unit of Work class further enhances this architecture by managing transactions across multiple repositories. It ensures that a group of operations either complete successfully or fail together, promoting data integrity.

The project structure includes:

- **Controllers:** Handle incoming HTTP requests.
- **Services:** Implement business logic and interact with repositories.
- **Repositories:** Encapsulate data access logic using the Generic Repository pattern.
- **Models:** Define your data entities.

## Configuring Database Connection

The connection string for the database can be configured in the `appsettings.json` file. Modify the `DefaultConnection` string to point to your desired database server and name.

```json
"ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Server=your-server;Database=your-database;User Id=your-user;Password=your-password;"
}
```
